# Astronaut's Dashboard

An astronaut is going to the International Space Station and has requested that you build a browser based dashboard for them to use on board the ISS. They want to keep up to date with what's going on in their home city to stop them from getting too homesick. They also want to be able to write notes or a diary to send back home.

You should make an app that uses APIs to bring in data about what is happening back on Earth. This may include photos, weather, news, timezones/sunrise times or anything else you think relevant. In addition there should be a note taking aspect where a user can input text snippets and save them with a time/date stamp.

## MVP

- At least two APIs being used to bring in data relevant to a specific place.
- A note taking / diary feature that saves text data with a timestamp which can then be retrieved - this may use a database or just local storage.
